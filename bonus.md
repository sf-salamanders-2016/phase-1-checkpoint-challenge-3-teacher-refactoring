# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
  - allows us to include default variables without worrying about whether or not they are falsey.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
  - allows for a flexible number of arguments

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?

  - single responsibility I think is the most important; breaking something down to the smallest possible problem makes life so much easier.  The same goes for encapsulation and abstraction, when you keep everything separate it is easier to find the bug and fix it.
